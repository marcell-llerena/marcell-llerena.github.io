## Steam Games Recommender System

[![Open Web App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Heroku-Open_Web_App-blue?logo=Heroku)](https://steam-games-recommender-system.herokuapp.com/)

<div style="text-align: justify">
I built a recommeder system of Steam video games based on content, which use characteristic information as description about the game, genres, tags and developer.

## Trailblazers Qualification Challenge

<h3><a href="https://zindi.africa/competitions/be-a-trailblazer">Challenge hosted by Zindi</a></h3>

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/trailblazers_qualification_challenge.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">
The objective of this challenge is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the percentage of households per ward that are female-headed and living below a particular income threshold, by using data points that can be collected through other means without an intensive household survey like the census.
As start point to resolve this challenge: I made an exploratory data analysis (EDA) in order to get most representative features and trained a basic random forest regressor.

## Detection and classification with deep learning

<div style="text-align: justify">
Try to detect and classify when a potential risk dog has not a muzzle, can avoid
future attacks against other dogs or pedestrians. In that sense, in this project
I used a faster R-CNN pre-trained on COCO dataset to detect dogs, and other model to classify if a dog has or no muzzle.
The second model uses EfficientNet as feature extractor and a classifier is trained from scratch. The performance at the moment is quite encouraging.

## Tracking with particle swarm optimization

<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project, I am going to perform tracking based on color using particle swarm optimization.
Nowadays, deep learning beat classic methods to tracking, but it is worth how heuristics work to this particular challenge.

## Turtle Recall Classification: Data cleaning

<h3><a href="https://zindi.africa/competitions/turtle-recall-conservation-challenge">Challenge hosted by Zindi and DeepMind</a></h3>

<div style="text-align: justify">
In order to classify different turtles, was necessary to clean the data of possibly duplicate or outliers images.
First, I used different pre-trained models as Resnet-101 and Resnet-152 to get average of the embeddings of the same class and discard embeddings with high cosine similarity (duplicate) or low cosine similarity (outliers).
