<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project, I am going to perform tracking based on color using particle swarm optimization.
Nowadays, deep learning beat classic methods to tracking, but it is worth how heuristics work to this particular challenge.

<div style="text-align: justify">
In order to classify different turtles, was necessary to clean the data of possibly duplicate or outliers images.
First, I used different pre-trained models as Resnet-101 and Resnet-152 to get average of the embeddings of the same class and discard embeddings with high cosine similarity (duplicate) or low cosine similarity (outliers).
